<h2 title="FINANCIAL">American Missionary Association.</h2>

<hr class="tb" />


<p>Our receipts for the first four months of the present fiscal year,
ending Jan. 31, 1883, amounted to $85,555.11, an increase of
$1,661.72 over the amount received for the corresponding months of
the previous year. The legacies, however, this year, have amounted
to $25,141.83, against $9,191.72 for the year before, showing a
falling off in collections and donations of $14,288.39. We desire,
therefore, to remind our readers that the enlargement so greatly
needed and so deeply felt by the friends who attended our last
annual meeting and reviewed the work of the Association cannot be
accomplished unless the receipts are greatly increased.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>We devote considerable space in this issue to a report of
a week’s work by our lady missionaries. We believe that what they
are doing is vital to the welfare of the families from which many
of our students come, and wish to commend the work and workers to
the prayers and sympathies of the patrons of this Association.</p>

<hr class="chap" />
</div>

<div class="article">
<h3>COST OF LADY MISSIONARIES.</h3>

<p>We sincerely hope that those who read the record of a Week’s Work
by our lady missionaries will carefully consider the value of these
labors, and the importance of the question as to their duty in
aiding to supply the vast want that exists at the South for this
kind of Christian service. It takes four hundred and fifty dollars
to provide for a lady missionary for one year, including traveling
expenses, board and a moderate salary.</p>

<p>Are there not some societies of ladies who will pledge us the
amount needful, and by so doing have a missionary of their own
in the field? Are there not individuals who will promise as much
for the same purpose? We shall be most happy to answer inquiries
relating to details.</p>

<h3 title="PARAGRAPHS"></h3>

<p>The pastor at Hampton writes: “Every night for the last
two weeks we have been having meetings for prayer, and the whole
school has been deeply moved. Many have already confessed their
love for Christ, and there are many now seeking Him. General
Armstrong and all the teachers are thoroughly in earnest in the
matter. The General made a most earnest appeal to the students last
evening, in which he said that nothing like it had been known in
the history of the school.”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>We have received intelligence from Rev. D.&nbsp;K. Flickinger,
D.D., who has made in Liverpool, London and Glasgow preliminary
inquiries relating to the John Brown steamer. It was his purpose
on reaching Sierra Leone to learn definitely as to the necessary
capacity of the boat for the use of the mission. He hoped also to
be able to conclude contract with the Governor of Sierra Leone for
carrying mails and for doing other business which would be a source
of income to the mission without interfering with its special work.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Rev. J.&nbsp;M. Hall writes from the Good Hope Station of a
prosperous year’s work among the Mendi and Sherbro people. He says:
“One year ago yesterday I took charge of the spiritual work at this
station. We have had 48 eleven o’clock Sabbath services, 48 Sabbath
night services, 40 Wednesday night services, 360 early morning
six o’clock services, not including the class and children’s
Friday afternoon services. I have received eight persons into the
church, five on profession of faith in Christ, have baptized 25
children, and married one couple. I have traveled two thousand
miles in search of medical treatment and in the interest of the
mission, notwithstanding that I have been confined to my bed and
room twenty-two times with this most dreadful fever. We trust that
we shall by the grace of God be enabled to do more the next year
if permitted to live. Our schools, both Sabbath and day, have been
well attended. The work is certainly a great one and I like it more
and more every day.”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The <cite>Baptist Home Mission Monthly</cite> makes its appearance
with enlarged form and new dress. Its first cover page is
tastefully embellished to indicate the scope of work carried on
by the Baptist Home Mission Society. Its twenty-four pages are
packed with pertinent paragraphs, passages of Scripture, personals,
pictures, poetry, there being over one hundred separate articles,
items, etc., etc. It is edited with the pen, quotation marks being
particularly scarce. Care, literary skill and discernment have been
used in the selection and arrangement of topics, and wide range
has been given in the discussion of matters relating to the world
of missions. The work expended on this publication will stimulate
other societies in providing missionary literature abreast with
the demands of the age. We extend to our Baptist brethren our
gratulations.</p>

<div class="article">
<h3>A PERMANENT NECESSITY.</h3>

<p>Temporary evils call for temporary agencies and remedies, but
permanent conditions of society require permanent and adequate
provisions to meet these demands. The confident prediction that the
freedman would rapidly fade away before the superior white races,
suggested to the humane that he should be made comfortable in
some sort of field hospital while he lingered, and made ready, if
possible, for a speedy departure to a more congenial world, where
perhaps the conditions of life would not be so unfavorable for his
continued existence.</p>

<p>The figures given by the unsentimental census-taker showing that
during the past decade there has been an increase of about 34 per
cent. of this race in our population does not indicate that the
black belt stretching along our Southern horizon is likely to
fade away. The negro is here to stay, and in adjusting him to our
natural life we are faced by a permanent, not a temporary problem.</p>

<p>We must either take counsel of the Egyptians and “deal wisely”
with this people and so prevent their increase, or broadly and
comprehensively deal with the question of fitting them for a
large and permanent place as an integral part and most important
factor of our Republic. If we deal wisely with them we must bear
in mind first of all that they are here and will remain here, and
their character and condition will enter largely into that of our
national life and character.</p>

<p>It is not beyond the limits of modest truth to say that the victory
which has been gained over Southern prejudices against the free
common school systems was gained, not by the political conventions
which established them by constitutional provisions, but by the
missionary training-schools and the teachers sent out by them; but
the fact that these are established does not supersede a necessity
for the schools which gained this victory. An intelligent gentleman
who was appealed to for aid in the endowment of one of these
said: “Private charity has demonstrated the possibility and value
of negro education, but it is a work for which it is altogether
inadequate. It must be done in the South as in the North by the
States themselves. These rapidly increasing millions must be, and
can be, cared for alone in schools sustained by government. Your
missionary, pioneer, experimental work has been done so wisely
and so well that its success has superseded the necessity of its
continuance.”</p>

<p>The answer to this is of course not far to seek. Yale and Harvard
did not grow out of the common school systems of Massachusetts and
Connecticut, but made these possible and efficient by supplying the
prime conditions of a good school-trained teachers. These colleges
were founded not by the State, but by private philanthropy, as all
such schools have been, for on no theory which has been accepted
as to the functions of government can such be built by the State.
The primary and preparatory work which has been done by the schools
of the A.&nbsp;M.&nbsp;A. will<a class="pagenum" name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a> indeed be remitted, more and more, to the
common schools of the States, but there will always be a demand
and a necessity for fully endowed colleges and universities for
the higher education of the teachers and leaders of this people;
and neither the highest efficiency of the public school, nor the
fullest development of such universities as Vanderbilt and similar
schools for the white race, will lessen the need of such schools as
Fisk and Atlanta Universities. If the day shall ever come, as come
it certainly will, when these schools for whites shall strike out
the word white, and admit all who seek their advantages, it will
come as the result of a work which they are not doing now.</p>

<p>The prejudice which now excludes the negro will yield only to
established facts, but will not, from the nature of the case,
create these facts. When educated negroes in all the public
callings of life shall have proved “that a man is a man for all
that,” that what entitles him to respect and honor lies deeper
than the color of his skin, and is not to be determined at all by
its peculiar shade, so that separate schools will not be demanded
for him, he will come in such numbers that those now established
for him will be urgently needed for the accommodation of students,
regardless of color. Thus are we led by our just and reasonable
views to the conclusion that the schools for higher training of
the negro, established by the A.&nbsp;M.&nbsp;A. and kindred societies, are
demanded for a permanent work most vitally related to all that
is dear to us as Christians and patriots, and that permanent and
adequate endowments for them must be made if these interests are to
be conserved.</p>

<h3>GENERAL NOTES.</h3>


<h4>AFRICA.</h4>

<p>&mdash;On Nov. 12th, Bishop Crowther, while at Sierra Leone, on his way
back to the Niger, admitted three Africans to deacon’s orders. Gov.
Havelock and other Europeans were present, and more than eighteen
hundred native Christians.</p>

<p>&mdash;The C.M.S. Committee has presented a memorial to Lord Granville
on the question of slavery and the slave-trade in Egypt. Pressure
is brought to bear upon the Government not to miss the present
opportunity of using the influence and power of England to abolish
slavery itself, and so put a stop to the slave-trade.</p>

<p>&mdash;The River Gambia Trading Company has been incorporated in London
with a capital of $750,000.</p>

<p>&mdash;A new station has been founded among the Angoni by Dr. Laws and
Mr. Koyi, of the Livingstonia Mission.</p>

<p>&mdash;The gross weight of diamonds passed through the post-office of
Kimberley, South Africa, in 1880, was 1,440 pounds, estimated at
$16,839,485.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></p>

<p>&mdash;Captain Burton and Commander Cameron, on their return from the
West African Gold Fields, reported that the wealth of the land was
prodigious. “Gold dust is found by native women from the sands of
the seashore. Gold spangles glitter after showers in the streets
of Azim. Gold is yielded by the lumps of yellow swish that rivet
the wattle walls of hut and hovel. Our washings range from half an
ounce to four ounces per ton.”</p>

<p>&mdash;In 1880, the number of Protestant communicants in Africa,
according to Dr. Behm, was 122,470. The number composing the
communities in the midst of which these were found was 506,966.
Thirty-four religious societies were prosecuting the work
represented in these communities.</p>

<p>&mdash;Dr. Blyden, President of Liberia College, reports increasing
prosperity among the immigrants who have gone from this country.
The commercial interests of Liberia are indicated by the fact that
one vessel, the bark Monrovia, brought 150,000 pounds of coffee to
New York on a recent trip.</p>

<p>&mdash;The last report from the missionaries of Tabora marks great
progress in the transportation of letters. The mails have become
more regular, nothing is lost on the route, and the roads are
safer. The Wanyamouesis mounted guides are very capable, and there
is this advantage in employing them that on the return trip, going
back to their homes, they delay less than the other natives. The
station of Ouyoug has met with great misfortune in the loss of Dr.
Southon, who, while filling the place of missionary, has rendered
great service as a physician to the population.</p>

<h4>THE CHINESE.</h4>

<p>&mdash;A Baptist preacher in Portland, Oregon, named Fung Chak, reports
a church of 65 Chinese converts.</p>

<p>&mdash;During the first three months after the anti-Chinese law went
into operation, 3,849 Chinese departed from the Pacific coast, and
only 169 arrived.</p>

<p>&mdash;The Presbyterian Board has purchased a large and valuable
building, in San Francisco, at a cost of $22,500, for a Chinese
Mission.</p>

<p>&mdash;Mr. Yung Wing, so well known for his efforts in establishing a
school for the Chinese in Hartford, Conn., has been appointed chief
magistrate of the city of Shanghai.</p>

<p>&mdash;The British and Foreign Bible Society entered China in 1843, and
has agents at Shanghai, operating chiefly through the missionaries
of the different societies.</p>

<p>&mdash;A Chinese Sunday-school was opened in Farwell Hall, Chicago,
in 1878. The number of regular attendants at the present time is
between fifty and sixty. On Monday, Tuesday, and Thursday evenings,
secular instruction is given them. The school is under the auspices
of the Y.&nbsp;M.&nbsp;C.&nbsp;A.</p>


<p>&mdash;Soon after the American Board, in response to the suggestion
of the A.&nbsp;M.&nbsp;A., decided to open a mission at Hong Kong, a
Thanksgiving offering, amounting to $114, was made by Miss Harriet
Carter’s Chinese Sunday-school, Mount Vernon Church, Boston. The
money was paid over to the treasury of the Am. Board.</p>

<h3>LEXINGTON HIGH SCHOOL.</h3>

<p class="secauth">BY PROF. GEO. F. JEWETT.</p>

<p>Nearly every one knows of the far-famed blue grass region of
Kentucky. It is seventy miles south of Cincinnati, and fifty miles
east of Louisville. Lexington is in the very heart of this fertile
country, eighty miles south of Cincinnati, on the Cincinnati
Southern R.R. The country excels in the production of corn,
potatoes and thorough-bred stock, and it is said that the finest
horses in the United States are raised in this region. Lexington is
one of the oldest towns of Kentucky and has a population of 16,500,
of which one half is colored. Although Kentucky did<a class="pagenum" name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a> not take a
very active part in the late war, yet at its close the provisions
for the education of the colored people were as meagre as in other
States.</p>

<p>Last June the Association decided to re-open the school, and
accordingly the building was repaired. The cut given herewith
represents the house in its present shape. On the first floor there
are two large school-rooms capable of seating fifty pupils each,
two large entries and two coat rooms. On the second floor there are
two large school-rooms which may be thrown into one by means of
folding-doors, thus forming our chapel. There are also two small
recitation-rooms. In the front of the building there is a hall and
stairway. The house is also provided with a large bell, which is
a great help in securing punctuality. Our school numbers 133, 38
males and 95 females. There are 31 above 16 years of age. None are
admitted below the fourth reader. The school is divided into three
grades&mdash;high school, first and second grammar grades. Miss H.&nbsp;C.
Minton is teacher of the first grammar grade, and Mr. C.&nbsp;H. Jewett
of the second. Our scholars are not far advanced, because of the
very poor advantages which they have had; yet they are a class of
well-behaved and earnest pupils.</p>

<p>The discipline of the school is very easy. The scholars respect
their teachers and seem to consider the school a means by which
they are to rise. Our school-house is far superior to any building
in the city for colored schools. This gives us a great advantage.
We are obliged to turn away many from the lower grades. The State
has just passed a law making the salary of white and colored
public-school teachers equal. This makes it important that the
colored teachers should fit themselves better for their work. Our
school is intended to offer them opportunities for doing this work.</p>

<h3>A WEEK’S WORK BY LADY MISSIONARIES.</h3>

<hr class="tb" />


<h4>FIRST CONGREGATIONAL CHURCH, SELMA, ALA.</h4>

<p class="center"><i>By Miss Mary K. Lunt.</i></p>

<p><i>Sunday, Jan. 14.</i>&mdash;A bright, crisp morning, and as we prepare
for Sunday-school, we think that many of the little ones will be
necessarily detained from their accustomed places, or at least,
be obliged to see their cards with unclipped figures upon them.
But no, one hundred and nineteen are present, a good average,
and but few are tardy, notwithstanding that many have walked
a long distance, and perhaps without having taken breakfast.
At 9:30 <span class="smcap lowercase">A.M.</span> the opening exercises commence&mdash;singing,
prayer, chanting the Lord’s Prayer, and responsive reading&mdash;after
which the weekly offerings are collected in envelopes, and the
amount subsequently reported, also the number of pupils present,
reported by the Secretary. The contributions are appropriated as
follows: First Sunday of the month, for needy Sunday-schools;
second and third, our own needs; fourth, our church; fifth,
foreign missions. Several schools have been aided by this method,
and the pupils bring their papers carefully folded, to be sent
to other Sunday-schools. Collections last year amounted to $50,
revealing the fact that scarcity of nickels does not keep them
from helping others less favored. After the re-assembling of the
classes, two of which, the infants, the girls named “Buds of
Promise,” the boys, “Little Soldiers,” are taught in the rooms
below, the main school comprising eight classes and one Bible
class; their attention is directed to illustrations and lesson
topics on the board by the superintendent, supplemented by remarks
on the lesson from the pastor. Some of our teachers and pupils
have read original papers on the subject of the lesson for the
morning, this being an incentive to a more thorough study of the
lesson. At 11 <span class="smcap lowercase">A.M.</span> we are seated for the morning service,
and after the usual opening exercises and responsive reading<a class="pagenum" name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a> we
listen to an earnest discourse, founded on the closing passages
of that wonderful Sermon on the Mount, contrasting the builders,
showing the foolishness of building religious characters on false
pretenses, and the importance of building on the solid rock Christ
Jesus.</p>

<p>At 3 <span class="smcap lowercase">P.M.</span> is the children’s meeting known as the “Look
Up Legion,” but called by some the “Look Up ’ligion,” composed
of members of our own and other Sunday-schools of the city, ages
ranging from two and a half to twelve years. Their regular and
prompt attendance attests their interest and zeal. One of the
members of the choir assists in leading the singing, which is a
prominent feature of the hour. Our principal readings and talks are
taken from the book, “Talks to Boys and Girls about Jesus.” Always
when available we give them a short juvenile temperance story,
and distribute books and papers when we have them. Our motto is
“Lend a Helping Hand,” and the aim to teach to become children of
the Great King, to help others to become such by inducing them to
come to Sunday-school and to these meetings, where they can hear
about Jesus. One little girl said to us to-day, “I am glad you
have these meetings, for I get tired reading, and mamma won’t let
me play.” One of the larger boys is anxious to know if we are to
continue them during the year. At 7 <span class="smcap lowercase">P.M.</span>, with a good and
attentive congregation, we listen to one of a series of illustrated
sermons, which has been our privilege since Christmas, an earnest
and solemn appeal to the unconverted from the passage in Rev. vi.,
13-17, plainly proving that the fear and confusion of those who
cried “Fall on us and hide us,” resulted from the sinner’s own
carelessness and indifference, and it is hoped that the truth found
lodgment in the hearts of the hearers, and will bring forth fruits
meet for repentance. Our day closes full, and if in after years we
see the young filling honorably responsible positions, we shall not
regret that we were “sent.”</p>

<h4>MISSIONARY WORK, SAVANNAH, GA.</h4>

<p class="center"><i>By Miss Jane S. Hardy.</i></p>

<p><i>Monday, Jan, 15.</i>&mdash;Early dawn found me wide awake, and planning
the work of the day. Soon the accustomed “ding dong” caused a
general stir in the Home, and the second call brought us all
into the dining-room, where we soon satisfied our bodily wants,
and on bended knee sought “supplies of grace” for our spiritual
needs. Soon another bell announced the approach of school-time,
and nearly two hundred pupils gathered, as was their wont, in the
chapel of Beach Institute. There God’s blessing was again invoked,
both in song and prayer, a few words of counsel were given by the
Superintendent, and the scholars were dismissed to their respective
school-rooms.</p>

<p>I would fain have lingered there; for it brought to my mind
the many years of happy toil spent among <em>my</em> pupils in the
school-room. Yet I am content&mdash;yea, happy, in doing the work that
comes to my hand in visiting from house to house.</p>

<p>My first call this morning was upon the Deacon’s wife, who greeted
me in her usual lady-like manner. Although often bending over
wash-tub or ironing-board, she leaves all to be taught her reading
and Bible lesson. She is not a Christian, but the truth brought
before her in repeated Scripture readings is evidently making deep
impressions.</p>

<p>My next call was at the house of a church member, but a
wanderer&mdash;bitterness in her heart, “cares of this life and the lust
of other things entering in have choked the word and made her life
unfruitful.” She cannot read; but I have resolved to carry the word
to her. May God lead her back to her Father’s house!</p>

<p>Mrs. K&mdash;&mdash; is a cripple. For her diseased feet I carried a pair of
soft shoes, sent by some good friend in the North.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></p>

<p>I found her with a company of children gathered about her whom she
was teaching to read, thereby earning five or six dollars a month.
She is an intelligent Christian woman, and has lately been reading
“Prince of the House of David,” for which she expresses great
admiration.</p>

<p>Hastening home, I met a class of young men&mdash;hotel-waiters&mdash;who are
off duty in the middle of the day, and desire to improve their
leisure time in studying the three R.’s and the Bible.</p>

<p>At two o’clock, I went into the school building to attend a prayer
meeting held daily among the pupils since the opening of the Week
of Prayer. There are indications of the Spirit’s presence among us,
and we are anxiously hoping that some of these dear young people
may be turned to the service of Christ.</p>

<p>After dinner I went to a distant part of the city to meet a regular
appointment for a ladies’ prayer meeting. This week the meeting
was held at the house of a good sister, who kindly opened her
well-furnished parlor. A good number gathered to hear the word
and to mingle their petitions at the throne of grace. Among those
present was Mrs. S&mdash;&mdash;, who, so lately, came into the kingdom.
Her great desire is to work for the Master. Thus passed an hour,
helpful, I trust, to us all. Returning home, I felt called upon,
ere night should close in, to visit a family much afflicted by
sickness. Both father and mother weak and feeble, no ready cash
in hand, and seven small children to care for. No wonder the
days look dark to them. We are glad to give them a helping hand.
A few articles of clothing, a little money, and words of cheer
are the things they most need just now. In the evening a Sunday
school scholar came for instruction, giving me another opportunity
to sow seeds of truth in a darkened mind. How precious are the
opportunities that come to us day by day!</p>

<h4>MISSION WORK AT ATLANTA, GA.</h4>

<p class="center"><i>By Miss Lizzie Stevenson.</i></p>

<p><i>Tuesday, Jan. 16.</i>&mdash;The heavy rains since my return from the
North, Jan. 3, have kept me much at home. This morning, however,
I started out, and soon found myself at Aunt Judy’s door, but she
had gone to a neighbor’s to get warm. When she saw me, she said,
“Missus I’s so glad you’se come back. I was just talkin’ about
you. We folks don’t have nobody to come roun’ and see and talk to
us since you’se gone.” She has been a cripple for years, but this
winter is unable to work, on account of rheumatism. She has always
been contented and happy, and “proud” that she could pay her rent,
fifty cents a week. But to-day it made my heart ache when she
said that it took all that “Wes,” a grandson ten years old, could
make by picking up rags and papers to get something to eat and a
little coal. The landlady had just been there for rent, but she
did not know where she could get the money. After reading a few of
the Saviour’s words, and commending her to the Father’s care, I
gave her a little toward the rent and left her. I next found two
children about two and four years old hovering around a handful of
coals; talked with them a few minutes, gave them a picture paper
and passed on. I then stopped at Aunt Gracie’s and knocked, but no
answer; so I pushed open the door and went in, and spoke several
times before I could rouse her. Then with great effort she told
me that she had been in bed several days with rheumatism. Her
miserable shanty is but poor protection from the rain. Every thing
in the room was damp, and not a stick of wood or a mouthful of any
thing to eat. I carried her a little food and sent to the wood-yard
for wood. But the streets, which are not paved, were so muddy they
would not deliver nor sell even an <em>armful</em>.</p>

<p>Next I find Mrs. Williams, who has been sick for two months. She
is very old, and has for years supported herself and two orphan
children by picking up rags.<a class="pagenum" name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a> As soon as it was light she could be
seen with her sack on her shoulder going to her work. She is quite
sick, but fortunately she belongs to a society, which provides for
her. From here I go to see an Auntie who is over one hundred years
old. She is unable to lie down on account of asthma. As she sees
who it is she exclaims “Bless the Lord, honey, I knowed the good
Lord would send you back, kase we old folks haint got no one to
come round and read to us when you’se gone! ’Pears like the rest
are so busy. I prayed the Lord would send you back, and I felt it
in my bones you’d come;” and she thanked the Lord again and again
for sending me back. And at so many places their first exclamation
was to thank the Lord for sending me back to read to them. Another
poor woman, who has not walked for years, and whose husband has
deserted her, is entirely dependent on the neighbors for her
support; and no doubt she goes hungry many days. She said to me
as I was leaving, “Miss Lizzie, I didn’t get no Christmas ’cause
you’se gone.” After making several other calls and distributing
quite a number of Sunday-school papers, I came home with a sad
heart to think how little I could do to relieve these poor needy
ones. Sometimes I feel that it is mockery to offer to read to them,
when they are so cold and hungry. If I only had the <em>means</em> to make
their bodies comfortable, they could enjoy so much more the food
for the soul.</p>

<h4>DAY’S WORK FOR JESUS&mdash;RALEIGH, N.C.</h4>

<p class="center"><i>By Miss E.&nbsp;P. Hayes.</i></p>

<p><i>Wednesday, Jan. 17.</i>&mdash;As this is the day for our woman’s prayer
meeting, I had taken that day to call on the members of our church.
After breakfast, I was preparing to start, when Georgia came in to
inquire if I had heard from the ladies who were coming from the
North. Then Mr. Smith, our pastor, called to decide upon articles
to be read at the concert the next Sabbath evening on the work of
the A.&nbsp;M.&nbsp;A. I wrote a postal to thank the lady who sent a nice
silk hood to an old, sick auntie, and started.</p>

<p>It was raining a little, but I determined to proceed. I made the
first call at Mr. Young’s, close by. Mr. Y. is blind and paralyzed.
They were eating breakfast. It was then 10 o’clock. Mrs. Y. said
they had nothing to eat till she went out and hunted up something.
One day during the snow, as they had no wood, they were obliged to
remain in bed till three in the afternoon, and the Saturday night
before they had no wood, and nothing to eat. I furnished them
with enough to last over the Sabbath. As Mrs. Young is a reader
I gave her a paper, and went on to Mrs. Hills. Mrs. H. has two
little children, and cannot get out to church, but is very fond
of reading. I found her with a good coal fire, and looking very
comfortable. I left a paper, and stepped into Mrs. Smith’s to see
if her children were as destitute as she had represented and to
request her to send her boy to the wood-yard to order some wood
for me. I met her husband coming out half drunk, and talking in
very loud tones. The boy was stretching a line around the room in
which they lived for his mother to dry the washing she took in.
Some wet wood in the fire-place was making a feeble effort to burn.
I couldn’t see how clothes could dry in such a place as that, and
said so to Mrs. S. She replied that she was compelled to dry them.
When I came out, the rain was pouring down, but I was obliged to go
to the Bank to get a check cashed, as I was out of money, and was
expecting a barrel of clothing with a freight bill to be paid.</p>

<p>After going to the Bank, drug store and post-office, the rain and
mud conquered and I turned my face homeward, feeling thankful when
I entered my door that I had so good a shelter. I built a fire,
or tried to, with wet wood, as all our wood is soaked with rain
when we buy it, and spent an hour in selecting Bible verses for a<a class="pagenum" name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a>
Sunday-school class coming in the evening to study for a concert
the last Sabbath in the month, partly wrote a letter to thank the
ladies of Hopkinton for a barrel of clothing, and to interest them
further in the work.</p>

<p>After lunch, Dea. Jones called to inquire about his part for
concert. As the rain had slackened, I went to prayer meeting at
three o’clock, at Dea. Dunston’s. We meet with the different
members of the church. Dea. D. is our oldest member, seventy-three,
in feeble health, and enjoys having us meet with them. But five
were there, and three of those members of the family. All took
part in the meeting, and after its close, I assisted the daughter,
in selecting an article to read at the concert. She chose for her
subject the Indians.</p>

<p>When I came home I looked over the mail, and went to inform Mrs.
Bembry, with whom I had engaged board for the Northern ladies, that
they would arrive Friday morning. On my way I stepped in to see
an old lady who is paralyzed, and called to tell Georgia when the
ladies would arrive. In the evening a Sunday-school class came to
study verses, and get temperance cards. Then I finished my letter,
wrote another and retired, feeling that I had accomplished but
little.</p>

<h4>ONE DAY’S WEAVING&mdash;MONTGOMERY, ALA.</h4>

<p class="center"><i>By Miss Rebecca G. Jillson.</i></p>

<p><i>Thursday, Jan. 18.</i>&mdash;The Swayne School for the colored children
of Montgomery, with its four hundred scholars, is just opposite
the “Teachers’ Home.” The day began with a call at the school; a
bundle of Sunday-school papers was soon distributed among the boys.
Near the school-house lives a good woman, from whose home two girls
have just gone to Talladega to school. I stop and talk with her
about their going and read a letter for her. A neighbor needs help,
the mother and seven children are all sick. Although dependent on
friends for care, these are the sick woman’s words: “We’re all
down, but old Marsa knows what He’s doing.”</p>

<p>On the porch of the next house stands an old grandmother, children
of all ages around her. A girl of eighteen promises to come to the
Home twice a week for lessons. Across the way lives a kind-hearted
woman; her neighbor, a sick woman, has only her little son and
this friend to care for her. She needs much the comfort of God’s
word and his assuring promises of help. Another is waiting for
sympathy; she is alone though not widowed, and tells how, when the
human help on which she leaned failed, she found support in God
alone. A young woman whose husband’s health has failed is trying to
help him by keeping a little store; she is brave though sometimes
discouraged. The next call is on a woman just recovering from
illness. Her friends have been kind to her in her sickness; this
interest in one another is especially noticeable among the colored
people. Stopping to speak to a group of children, “this one, they
say, has no father or mother, so we have taken her in.” Two other
calls in this neighborhood are made; an invitation given to a young
man to attend the Singing School and to a young girl to renew her
interest in music; and now the house of a faithful church member is
reached. The Ladies’ Missionary Society and what work it may do is
discussed, and questions from the article on Missions in <span class="smcap">Life
and Light</span> are left to be prepared for the next meeting. Two
calls near by are made. One lady is interested in music and is
glad to hear of the cantata we are to learn. The next is a scene
of labor. This good woman washes for a large restaurant and has in
this way earned enough money to build a substantial house. Every
day piles of table-linen must be washed and ironed, and when it
rains, every corner in-doors is made use of to dry the hundreds of
napkins and towels.</p>

<p>The first call in the afternoon was on an old lady, a faithful
Christian, who finds<a class="pagenum" name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a> that her pilgrim journey has had in it many
passages and experiences like that of the pilgrim of old, in
whose story she is much interested. The Celestial City is for her
almost in view, and her entrance there will be triumphant. “I’se
only waiting,” she says, “for the Lord to say: ‘Elsie, come up to
glory.’”</p>

<p>Several girls come to the Home in the afternoon, two to learn to
make worsted hoods, two others to take lessons in music. There is
also time to fold the Sunday-school papers for distribution next
Sunday. Late in the afternoon I called on a mother whose little
child God had taken home to himself. Our next neighbor is a man of
intemperate habits. I had a talk with him. At nightfall a young
woman came in and sang some of the old plantation melodies. In the
evening a young girl came for lessons, and with her, two boys, who
spent the hour with pencil and drawing cards. With God’s blessing
may the day’s work not be in vain.</p>

<h4>A DAY IN NEW ORLEANS.</h4>

<p class="center"><i>By Miss A.&nbsp;D. Gerrish.</i></p>

<p><i>Friday, Jan. 19.</i>&mdash;Having attended morning devotions at the
University chapel, equipped with my satchel and a few gifts to be
distributed here and there, I wend my way to Mrs. R.’s to hold a
promised meeting. There are six of us altogether. At the close
of the brief hour spent with Jesus I stop to speak with a young
Catholic girl. The mother is evidently surprised. She “didn’t
know as I’d talk to such as she.” I reply, “I came to speak to
all.” My next call is at what I term the half-way house. A few
late flowers still bloom in the pretty garden and the oranges seem
turning a deeper gold, touched by the warm sunshine. Aunt Comfort
is “only just about so so.” We talk of household affairs and the
revival. An offered prayer for us both and I bid the dear old lady
good morning. On the street a sad-hearted mother delays me for a
moment to ask that I will please pray for her son, who is dying and
without hope in Christ. With a few kindly words of sympathy and a
promise to remember the young man, I pass on. The door of Mrs. A.’s
pleasant room stands open and I pause long enough on the threshold
to receive her cheery “Good morning” and the injunction to “be
sure and stop next time.” As I reach the top of a winding flight
of stairs a voice full of childish eagerness asks, “Did you bring
my little Testament?” The Testament, a tiny book, and some picture
papers are taken from my satchel and three little hearts for the
time made happy. The mother is very grateful for the garments given
her for the children. An urgent invitation is left with her to come
to the evening meeting. Another call made and the city bells ring
out the noontide hour. I stop for lunch and rest at Sister W.’s.</p>

<p>Mrs. M. lives at a distance, so I take the street cars. A rap at
the outside gate, a careful climbing up the rickety stairway and I
am warmly greeted by the little woman. Would that I had space to
describe to you her one bit of a room. She says: “You must excuse
it; ’tisn’t alus possible to keep things lookin jus so.” She has
received no pay for her last three months’ washing, so for want
of car fare her Sabbaths have been spent at home. I must tell her
all about the meetings, the New Year’s tree, how many have joined
the church, and affairs generally. With a prayer and a substantial
proof that the “Lord will provide” her heart is comforted. I find
Aunt Sally “jus tolable, thank’e, but powerful busy.” She tells me
once again, “’Twill be a glorious time, shur nuff, chile, when I
can leave this ere washtub for a manshun in de hebens.” I seek out
a delinquent Sabbath-school scholar and call upon two interesting
little girls, who promise to come to the sewing school. A picture
paper given to each and I hasten homeward.</p>

<p>After dinner I find a little time for writing. Promptly at 7
o’clock the church prayer meeting begins. The passage selected
for the evening lesson is Jer. 8:20.<a class="pagenum" name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a> The large audience listen
attentively to the pastor’s words. In the hush of this tender
interest nine come forward for prayers. The voice of petition
rises in their behalf. Two tell us that they have found Jesus. We
sing “Praise God from whom all blessings flow.” Benediction is
pronounced and the meeting closes. Another day, with its joys and
sorrows, its failure and success, is ended. Its record is with Him
who sees and understands. In the quiet of my room I kneel to humbly
ask that it may be accepted as “one more day’s work for Jesus,”
knowing that it is “one less of life” for us all.</p>

<h4>LINCOLN MISSION, WASHINGTON, D.C.</h4>

<p class="center"><i>By Mrs. C.&nbsp;B. Babcock.</i></p>

<p><i>Saturday, Jan. 20.</i>&mdash;Be sure and find us when you take your
pleasure trip to Washington, and we will show you better than we
can write, the need of missionary work among its 60,000 colored
people. This is one of our winter’s worst days. It rains fast, and
the streets are full of snow and water. Breakfast over, I hastened
to market for meat to make broth for the sick, and to the grocery
for bread. While picking my way over the slippery pavements, a
grandmother calls after me with a request that must be heeded. On
entering my room in the Mission, a barrel from Brooklyn awaits
unpacking. God bless the dear friends of the North who so nobly
respond to my appeal for help. They never will know how much good
the old clothes do. Before I’m half through, knock number one
brings old Auntie Bennett, afflicted with a disease so offensive
that she cannot attend our gatherings. When leaving with her bundle
of warm garments, in steps Auntie Harris, always so trustful in the
Lord, and yet she says, “I sat all yesterday without any fire”;
her husband and crippled son unable to provide. Thankful for a
little relief, she goes out to carry a big bundle to another poor
creature, who, with her old man, have scarcely a crust, and nothing
but a leaky shanty for shelter. Caller No. 3 is a young woman,
bringing a note from the police station and a certificate from her
doctor, that tells of serious sickness, one two-year-old child,
and nothing wherewith to help herself. I send her to see our Day
Nursery, and tell her to bring her baby on Monday, and I will see
what more can be done. Her dull, wan face brightens as she leaves.
Tom C. comes next&mdash;my boy, who draws our Temperance blackboard
illustrations, paints our signs, puts up Christmas decorations,
&amp;c. I’ve just received his fit in a suit; so, with a patch to mend
the sleeves, and more work under his arm, he goes. Pinkie T. has
framed some mottoes, and I ask her to hang them in the school room,
paying her with a pair of nice boots. Annie C., our missionary girl
from Howard U., comes to assist, and, as a member of the Doing-Good
Society of the school, this <span class="smcap lowercase">P.M.</span> brings a report from sick
Mr. Green. After preparations for the afternoon, and a peep into
the nursery, where the floors are being scrubbed and the children
are taking their bath (for, though the Associated Charities have
adopted this, my pet project of last year, and have appointed a
committee of ladies, I have the daily supervision). I leave for
lunch at 12½. The girl’s industrial school opens at 1½; 61
out of 130 scholars are present. We are divided into 15 classes,
each with a teacher, if enough ladies are present. I appoint a
girl to attend to callers. We open with singing, and sew until 3
o’clock. Some are making bags for their work, some patch-work,
some, fancy-work, while others are mending or making garments and
learning to cut them. We intersperse sewing-songs. They help the
pupils to remember instructions. From three to four we have various
exercises, such as talks on health or manners; Bible lessons,
repeating the Child’s Creed or the Commandments, with responsive
chant or a Psalm and the Lord’s prayer. To-day, we have an object
lesson in house-keeping. A table is placed on the platform and
Annie C. is asked to prepare it for<a class="pagenum" name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a> tea. She arranges the cloth,
dishes and food, with criticisms from the scholars. Then, she
invites four girls to sit and eat while she acts as waitress. After
eating she removes the dishes for washing and folds the cloth.
A few more callers and the busy week closes. Thank God for the
sunlight it has brought to us during our revival meetings in the
conversion of two of our dear girls.</p>

<h3>VANTAGE GROUND NEEDED BY STUDENTS.</h3>

<p class="secauth">BY MISS JOSEPHINE KELLOGG, TOUGALOO, MISS.</p>

<p>We long for the time when these people shall obtain a little
vantage-ground by industry and&mdash;still more essential&mdash;by economy
and a prudent use of earnings, so that the children may begin
the work of getting an education betimes and continue it until a
respectable course of study is thoroughly mastered. We have some
such, and we hope much from the earlier training and the favorable
circumstance of their having parents interested in educating them
and able to do it.</p>

<p>In the cases of a majority, they come to us already grown-up,
something having given them an ambition for better things than
they had known. They have their own way to make and can be in
school only a part of each year, many of them working nights and
mornings and one day of each week besides, to pay their board in
whole or in part. As the time approaches when exhausted funds and
worn-out clothing must compel them to go out and seek employment,
thoughts will wander and there will be a relaxation in the matter
of preparation and recitation of lessons in spite of themselves
and the exertions of their teachers. No doubt there is a blessing
connected with their struggles against adverse circumstances, and a
manly and womanly self-dependence is fostered in this way, but it
is not to be expected that a great number will complete the course
in the face of such discouragements.</p>

<p>As year after year passes, and they get education enough to help
them on somewhat in life and a knowledge that fits them to be
useful in church, society and home, and they yet seem almost as
far as ever from the goal of graduation which they once placed
before themselves, they begin to be anxious to settle down to the
real business of life, and they relinquish the hope of a completed
normal course with, perhaps, a subsequent complete collegiate
course.</p>

<p>While it is the few of those who enter that go on to the end of the
course and the many drop out as I have described, yet we do not
consider our labor in vain, but rather hope to claim the assurance
“Blessed are ye who sow beside all waters.” If the teaching were
only in the ordinary elementary branches we might think it of
little avail unless carried on continuously to a more satisfactory
issue, but much of it is more fundamental than even arithmetic. The
entire mode of life is a lesson and a much needed one to most of
those who come to us. The regularity of meals with the laws of the
dining-room, the regularity of retiring and rising, the neatness
and order of the rooms, the care of clothing, the personal habits,
the sanitary regulations, the study and exercise, and the propriety
of deportment required, not to speak of the regular work belonging
to the industrial training, seem to new scholars to form a complete
hedge, if not a bewildering labyrinth; but a very bright feature of
our work is the spirit of subordination and respect for constituted
authority, which greatly simplifies and lightens the enforcement of
all necessary rules. This is an excellent and much-to-be commended
trait in our students. I have asked some of those who go out to
teach if the children in the public schools are easy to govern. Oh,
yes, the answer has been, <em>they expect to mind</em>.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/hall.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="" />
<p class="center">LADIES’ HALL, TOUGALOO, MISS.</p>
</div>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></p>

<p>It is very edifying to note how those who come without any taste
or neatness in their personal appearance, with sorry attempts at
finery and painfully-laced waists, improve under the tuition of
the lady principal and the influence of those who have been here
longer, the expression of the countenance often changing more
rapidly and noticeably than even the manner of dress. But, O! the
patience and the faculty required for this most important work of
training the girls in womanly virtues and housewifely ways!</p>

<p>With all the patience and with all the faculty possible, it is a
great and constant strain to have the care of such a household,
and the matrons and lady principals need the uplifting prayers and
sympathy of the warm Christian hearts interested in these schools,
in a special degree.</p>

<p>And then the instruction in the Bible, as “the only and the
sufficient rule both of faith and practice”&mdash;the value of this work
cannot be over-estimated. The case of a young man who came into
school for the first time this fall, comes to mind. Living far
back from the railroad, in the country, he had had no advantages
of any schooling but a few brief sessions of the public school. He
was entered in the Third-reader grade and was to all appearance
a most unpromising specimen, although a professed Christian, and
apparently a sincere one, with a real experience of trust in God,
but wofully untaught as to Christian character and duty. As the
Scripture was from time to time plainly and searchingly expounded,
and the vices which are sometimes permitted under the garb of
religion were exposed, it was plain to see that he was listening
as to a new revelation. In school-room work there was a marked
improvement, especially in the expressiveness of his reading, but
the great benefit that came in his term of school was in the way of
moral enlightenment. A month ago he joined the temperance society.
The last prayer-meeting was taken up largely with speaking of the
temptations that would be met at Christmas-time to violate the
pledge, and one young man said that, in view of these temptations
he would rather spend Christmas at Tougaloo than anywhere else.
This young man then “spoke in meeting” for the first time, I think,
and said he did not feel that way. It seemed to him that the
principal thing he wanted to go home for, was to tell his people he
had become a temperance man. He had been a good deal of a drinker,
a member of church, too, and his people were all in the same way,
and didn’t know any better, but now he would tell them that he had
found a better way, and that they, too, must forsake the old bad
way, or they would surely go down. He said, “If I can’t keep my
pledge, I may as well find it out first as last, but <em>I do believe
I can</em>. I does feel as if temperance <em>is grafted in here</em>,” laying
his hand upon his breast. He hopes to return and bring a sister
with him, but if he cannot get the means and never comes, is there
not here a little bread cast on the waters?</p>

<p>The evening before school closed there was a beautiful Christmas
exercise, consisting of recitations, Scripture and music, lighted
by a large star of evergreen filled with burning candles. No doubt
many a new idea concerning the universal holiday was imbibed. This
was followed by an exhibition by the temperance society.</p>

<p>Thanksgiving day was a blessed occasion with us. Rev. Mr. Stickel
preached on Tests of Character, dwelling upon the test of faith
and the test of gratitude, basing his sermon upon the story of the
ten lepers. An opportunity has usually been given, in connection
with the morning service, for personal testimonies, and so many had
given themselves to the service of the Lord and so many had been
led into a fuller Christian experience since last Thanksgiving that
there was a real eagerness for this service, and a somewhat wistful
look on a good many faces when the meeting was closed without it.
At the end of dinner, however, President Pope rose and said such an
opportunity would be given then and there; that<a class="pagenum" name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a> we could not spend
a portion of the afternoon more profitably nor have a pleasanter
sort of after-dinner speeches than in recounting the good dealings
of God with us. Notwithstanding the fact that a Thanksgiving dinner
is about as well calculated to promote a spirit of thankfulness as
anything that can be mentioned, it was a little harder to rise from
the table and speak in the dining-room than in the chapel. Yet,
after the first momentary hesitation, the testimonies came, briefly
but freely, of gratitude for health, for success in work, for the
privilege of being at school, for the pardon of sins, and many
other things.</p>

<p>One young man said he had felt all the year, as never before, that
all his blessings came right from the hand of God. He had felt
it in his teaching, and had thanked God for all his success. He
thanked God for this school, and for those friends in the North
who had established it, and for all the benefits it is conferring
upon the people of this State. One youth said he was thankful he
had learned the true object of man’s life&mdash;what he was made for. He
used to think a man could serve God or let it alone&mdash;that his time
and faculties were his own, and he could do as he pleased. But now
he had learned that a man’s true calling is to serve the Lord. He
was glad to know that the great God has something for every one to
do, and has His eye upon the way he does it, and that his reward is
according to his faithfulness, and not according to the greatness
of the work. It seemed to make life worth living.</p>

<p>Prof. Salisbury was with us three days of the last week, in the
tour of the schools which he is making to get his work in hand.
He gave us a helpful talk in chapel one morning, and again gave
an account of the other schools he had visited, and we trust his
subsequent visits will aid in promoting the symmetry and efficiency
of the work of this school.</p>

<h2>THE INDIANS.</h2>

<hr class="chap" />
<h3>CHURCH AND SABBATH-SCHOOL WORK AT S’KOKOMISH, W.T.</h3>

<p class="secauth">BY REV. MYRON EELLS.</p>

<p>June 22d and 23d, 1874, this church was organized with eleven
members, only one of whom was an Indian. But while there was only
one Indian, it was hoped that God would bless the work so that
others would be induced to come in, and we have not been wholly
disappointed. Since that time twenty-eight Indians and half-breeds
have joined it and our new church at Jamestown, near Dunginess,
besides thirteen whites who have joined on profession, and thirteen
more by letter, making seventy-five in all, including the first
members. Forty-five Indian marriages have taken place here in a
Christian way, and twenty-seven funerals. All of those married,
who are alive, are still living together, owing mainly to the
Agent. Christian services at funerals are something about which
the Indians at first cared very little, and often have the dead
been hurried off to burial without even letting me know that any
one was dead; and their burying-ground with its small houses and
clothes, cloth and other things, was a curiosity to visitors. But
after a time, having made some slow improvements, they opened a new
burying-ground, and when the first grave was made the chief said
to me: “To-day we become white people. We do not like the idea of
having cloth and other things around our graves, and we expect that
there will be none of it here.” That was nearly four years ago, and
there are now no such things visible. At a later day I was absent
when one person died, and no white man was present at the funeral;
but<a class="pagenum" name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a> when I returned, the Indians asked me to make arrangements so
that if I should necessarily be absent some Christian white man
should go and help them bury their dead in a Christian manner.</p>

<p>A prayer-meeting was begun here as soon as the present Agent came
(before there was a church or minister), which has been constantly
maintained, and its influence has gone into all the Christian work
here. But it has been too old for some of the children, and too far
away and in a wrong language for many of the Indians; hence it has
been supplemented by children’s, ladies’ and Indian prayer-meetings.</p>

<p>It has been my custom, as I have been able, to hold such meetings
with the Indians at their logging camps. The following incidents
show a change. About six years ago they said they did not know how
to pray or what to say. So to help them we would say a sentence and
let one whom we supposed to be the most suitable in heart repeat
over the prayer, line after line. One evening something comical
struck one, and he burst out laughing in the midst of his prayer.
At another time a hunter came home during a prayer-meeting, and,
without any regard to it, came in, throwing down his saddle and
things, and talking very much as if there were no prayer-meeting
there. That Indian of late has been one of the leading ones to
pray. Another evening, when I was through and was leaving I said
“Good night,” and the reply came, “Good night,” but as I was
outside the door and shutting it, the words were added in a not
very complimentary way, in a lower tone and yet so that I heard
them, “old man.” That Indian, after going to great lengths in
gambling, has been one during the past few months to try to induce
his relations to enter the right road.</p>

<p>I have been reminded of these incidents lately by way of contrast,
because of the earnest requests that have come to me, during the
past few months, to go to the same place, and the earnest and
apparently hearty thanks which have come from the same persons and
the same camp for the same work.</p>

<p>About eight years ago an Indian was wandering around during
Sabbath-school time, and was asked why he was not inside the
church. His reply was, that the services were so much in English
that they were dry to him. Only when the time came for singing the
Chinook song was he interested. There was only one song, then,
but the necessity for them seemed to grow until there were enough
to make our little book, in 1878, “Hymns in the Chinook Jargon
Language.” Indians living away from the Reservation have learned
to sing them who have learned but little else about the Gospel,
because they could not sing them without learning them. They have
carried and sung them down the straits to Cape Flattery and across
the straits to British Columbia, to Indians I probably never shall
see, and some Gospel truths have gone with them. The Indians of
both tribes, however, Twanas and Clallams, felt that another
important step had been taken when last spring they could sing in
their own native language.</p>

<p>In our Sabbath-school we have always followed the plan of having
the scholars commit five or six verses a week to memory, and most
of those who have done the best in this respect have come into the
church. Eight out of ten of the highest on the list for 1878 are
now members, and the same proportion holds good for some other
years. In all, twenty-seven have come in on profession of faith
from the Sabbath-school.</p>

<h2>THE CHINESE.</h2>

<hr class="chap" />


<h3>COMITY.</h3>

<p class="secauth">REV. W.&nbsp;C. POND, SAN FRANCISCO.</p>

<p>From the first I have conducted the operations of our mission
on principles of denominational comity. There are five distinct
missions at work for the Chinese of California, besides our own.
The Presbyterian has schools in San Francisco, Oakland, Sacramento,
San José, and, perhaps, I may add, at Napa and Santa Rosa, though
I am not aware that the work done in these two places is directly
connected with their Board; the Methodist mission has schools
also in San Francisco, Oakland, Sacramento, and San José, and one
besides, at Chico; the Baptist and Episcopal missions conduct
each one school in this city; the United Presbyterian mission has
schools in Oakland and Los Angeles. The total number of schools
sustained by all these missions&mdash;so far as I am informed&mdash;is
thus 15. Our mission has six schools in San Francisco, and ten
elsewhere. Sacramento and Oakland are the only points outside
this city occupied by us and by other missions also. At each of
these points our schools were first established, and we have not
felt it due to comity to abandon <a name="Err_1" id="Err_1"></a>our work begun and carried on
for years because others came in to divide it with us. But we
have never yet planted a school in any field already occupied,
unless San Francisco be an exception, where the occupation was so
incomplete, that we, ourselves, having one school, have established
five others. I am led to these remarks partly because the facts,
it seems to me, are worth reporting, and partly because, just
now, questions of comity have been and are still before us to be
answered. Thus, in accordance with a purpose expressed at the
close of our last fiscal year, to do something this year for the
large colony of Chinese that has established itself in the town
of Chico, I visited that town last month. I heard of a school as
already established&mdash;though its existence had been before unknown
to the pastor with whom I had corresponded. I visited the school;
found four pupils present, and learned that it was sustained by
the Methodist Mission. There was room for so much more to be
done that I made conditional arrangements for planting a school
there. The condition was that the Methodist Mission should give us
cordial welcome and divide the field with us territorially. But our
Methodist brethren say that they would prefer to occupy the whole
territory, and promise to do so in adequate force, and therefore we
have withdrawn. The large town of Vallejo has a Chinese population
somewhat exceeding 200, and no one was caring for their souls. I
determined to put into that field the work which I had intended
to do at Chico. I have made arrangements accordingly&mdash;renting a
mission-house, engaging a teacher, and arranging for a helper to
go there as soon as the building can be made ready. But the school
will be in special relation with the Presbyterian Church, there
being no Congregational Church, except at South Vallejo, nearly
two miles distant. I have accordingly said to our Presbyterian
friends that I would establish and carry on the school, subject to
transfer at any time when their Board will assume the care of it,
and will reimburse our treasury for expenses incurred up to the
time of the transfer. At Los Angeles we had sustained a school for
two or three years, and several of our pupils had been brought so
clearly into Christian light and life that almost immediately after
the establishment of a Presbyterian mission there and the transfer
of our work to its care, they were baptized and received into the
Presbyterian church. But the brother to whose care the work was
committed removed, after about two years, to Oakland, and left it
in other<a class="pagenum" name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a> hands. This field has now become so large that it need
involve no criticism upon the mission already existing there to say
that there is room for another, and that souls in large numbers
are walking in darkness that might be led into light, if we should
resume the work we unwisely (I now think) laid down. I propose,
therefore, to do this as soon as I can command the time necessary
to visit Los Angeles, unless I should then find that the facts have
been incorrectly represented to me.</p>

<p>Two principles of denominational comity suggest themselves as the
outcome of my thought on these questions and these fields. The
first is <em>no crowding</em>; the mission already at work in a field, to
be left in sole possession, provided it will render the service
needed there; the second is, <em>no possession without occupation</em>; no
leaving of souls to perish because somebody’s dog is in the manger,
and a field has been entered but not worked. Am I right?</p>
</div>

<div class="article">
<h4>SOUND DOCTRINE.</h4>

<p>The following sermon-sketch was read for criticism by our helper,
Lee Sam, at our regular exercise last Wednesday afternoon. I
ventured to ask him whether he found what he had written in some
commentary, or whether it came from his own study of the text and
of related passages. He told me that it was what he himself had
thought out in Bible study. It may be interesting to see what
views of human depravity a thoughtful man unschooled in theology,
unbiassed by ancient traditions, untrammeled by any standards or
any creeds, has drawn forth for himself from the Word of God. The
text was in Romans, 5:21.</p>

<p>“That as sin hath reigned unto death, even so might grace reign
through righteousness unto eternal life by Jesus Christ our
Lord.”</p>

<p>1. What is meant by reigning unto death and reigning unto eternal
life? It means the work of Christ and the work of Adam. What was
the work of Adam? What is the work of Christ? The work of Adam
was the work of death. The sin of Adam brought death upon all our
race. In the 17th verse of this chapter “By one man’s offence
death reigned by one,” because Adam transgressed God’s command by
eating the forbidden fruit, so God turned him out of the Garden of
Eden. But we are of the race of Adam. He transgressed God’s will
and brought sin upon us all. But some say our hearts are full of
good when we are born, but, by and by, we learn the evil from the
others. But we don’t believe that; we see sometimes the little
baby when he begins to talk, then he tell lies; when he begins
to walk then he fight with others; when he know his parents then
he disobeys them; when he grow to be a man then he walks his own
way, it may be “committing adultery, fornication, uncleanness,
lasciviousness, idolatry, witchcraft, hatred, variance, emulations,
wrath, strife, seditions, heresies, envying, murders, drunkenness,
revelings.” So we know the evil is not learned from the others, we
have it when we are born. By getting away from God and doing those
wicked things we cause the death of both soul and body.</p>

<p>2. What is the work of Christ?</p>

<p>“In Christ shall all be made alive.” It is said, John, 5:21, “For
as the Father raiseth up the dead and quickeneth them, even so the
Son quickeneth whom he will.” In Adam all die, but in Christ shall
all be made alive.</p>

<p>How can we reign unto eternal life? If we want to obtain eternal
life we must come to Jesus and trust in Him. Jesus says, “All power
is given unto me in heaven and in earth.” In 1st John, 2:1, “If
any man sin we have an advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ, the
righteous.” Though we are sinners, and far from God He can bring us
back. But our God hates sin, he loves us, and would save us from
our sin, and bring us near to Him. “For God so loved the world
that he gave His only begotten Son that whosoever believeth in Him
might not perish but have<a class="pagenum" name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a> everlasting life.” Jesus came into the
world to save us. His whole life was spent in doing good, and at
last he died on the cross to give his life a ransom for many, for
all who will come to him and be saved. He is able to save us. We
are commanded to love the Lord with all our hearts and with all our
minds and with all our souls. Adam loved God with all his heart,
but lost God’s love. The Lord Jesus, by his holy spirit, restores
this love in our hearts, so that we do love him with all our hearts
and souls, and through Christ we can do all things. Without Jesus
we can do nothing. Christ gives us victory over death. In 1st Cor.,
15:55, 56, 57, “O death where is thy sting! O grave where is thy
victory! The sting of death is sin, and the strength of sin is the
law. But thanks be to God which giveth us the victory through our
Lord Jesus Christ.”</p>

<h3>LADY AGNES HAMILTON.</h3>

<p class="secauth">BY MISS HENRIETTA MATSON, NASHVILLE.</p>

<p>The teacher was passing from one to another of her pupils, taking
their names. “Missie, Capitola, Viola, Colly, Prudy, Vic,” were
some of the names already recorded, but here was a little mite of a
girl, who gravely gave her name as Lady Agnes Hamilton. The teacher
smiled, but kindly said, “Agnes, is it not?” “No, Lady Agnes,”
persisted the child, in a decided manner, that accorded well with
the name.</p>

<p>The little lady is, perhaps, seven years of age, but not larger
than an ordinary child of four. Her face is of a rich olive tint,
and now the scarlet mingles with the brown, as she becomes confused
and excited under the teacher’s questioning. Her eyes and hair are
brown, the latter with a golden tinge, falling in short, crisp
curls around her neck and face. The small, sensitive mouth, with
its childish bloom and sweetness, tempts the teacher to stoop down
and kiss her to atone for disturbing her with doubts in regard to
her title and rank.</p>

<p>Afterward, the teacher, becoming acquainted with the little Lady’s
mother, asked if that was her real name. “Her sure nuff name,
Miss,” was the reply. “Young Miss, she done names de chile. I was
stayin’ dar on de ole place, after de war, da <em>pays</em> me an’ my ole
man, kase we’se free, an’ we stays wid ’em a long spell. My little
gal was born dar, an’ young Miss Sue, she say she so little an
frail her name should allus be Lady. We calls her Lady most times,
but her sure nuff name is Lady Agnes Hamilton. Miss Sue done writ
it down. Lady feel mighty bad kase de teacher reckon her name
somefin else. Nary odder name Miss, an’ dats de truff.” Her right
and title thus established, the teacher no longer questioned the
sweet-faced little Lady, and indeed, soon came to believe that the
child belonged to nature’s true nobility. She was always, in school
and out, a veritable little lady. Mingling with the dusky children,
who were her playmates, some of them dirty and ragged, while her
own garments were always daintily neat she never manifested any
conscious superiority, but was always sweet and gentle and happy,
whether the rain fell or the sun shone. The secret of her wonderful
sweetness and gentleness was not in that her name was Lady, nor
because she was a lady, but because very soon after the school
began, this little girl, only seven years old, gave her heart to
Jesus, and became as truly one of his children, as though she had
waited until she was twenty.</p>

<p>Jesus, her Saviour, was a real presence to her&mdash;a wonderful Friend,
ever near to<a class="pagenum" name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a> help her, and she was careful in what she said and
did, because she was anxious to please Him in everything.</p>

<p>Often the little brown head dropped on the desk before her, and for
a few moments she was very still&mdash;then, when she lifted her face,
the soft eyes always sought her teacher’s face, and a loving look
was exchanged. The teacher knew that little Lady had been given a
victory over some temptation that had beset her childish heart. At
such moments she was very beautiful, perhaps it was the beauty of
Heaven shining in her small, dark face.</p>

<p>But she did not die because she was so good, as is sometimes said
of good children. It is a blessed truth that many good children
<em>live</em> long lives of usefulness, in which they are able to do
greater things for the Master, because they began to love and serve
Him when they were little children. Lady Agnes Hamilton was for
many years a student in one of the institutions of the South, and
is now the wife of a minister of the gospel, leading a happy and
useful life.</p>

<p class="center large">T. DE WITT TALMAGE, Editor.</p>

<p class="center">SPECIAL ANNOUNCEMENT.</p>

<p class="medium">With 1883 the SUNDAY MAGAZINE entered on a new series, with
the distinctive purpose of providing such a variety of reading
matter of the highest literary merit (entertaining, chaste and
instructive) as shall commend it to Christian parents and those
engaged in the instruction of the young. Its purpose is to provide
the healthiest, yet most sparkling literature, for young and old.
<span class="smcap">Dr. Talmage</span> is the real editor, and intends to put his
best work into it. Writers of the greatest acknowledged excellence
contribute to its pages, and <span class="smcap">THE ILLUSTRATIONS</span> are of a
higher grade than any that have hitherto appeared in the Magazine.</p>

<p class="medium">Among other unique attractions are the following twelve questions
answered by the leaders of each denomination:</p>

<ul class="smcap">
  <li>What is Methodism?</li>
  <li>What is Moravianism?</li>
  <li>What is Lutheranism?</li>
  <li>What is Episcopalianism?</li>
  <li>What is Presbyterianism?</li>
  <li>What is Swedenborgianism?</li>
  <li>What is Congregationalism?</li>
  <li>What is Roman Catholicism?</li>
  <li>What is the Baptist Church?</li>
  <li>What is the Church of the Disciples?</li>
  <li>What is the Dutch Reformed Church?</li>
  <li>What is the Reformed Episcopal Church?</li>
</ul>

<p class="medium">Rev. Moses D. Hoge, D.D., Richmond, Va.; Rev. Charles H. Hall,
D.D., Brooklyn, N.Y.; Rev. Chauncey Giles, D.D., Philadelphia, Pa.;
Rev. Isaac Errett, D.D., Cincinnati, O.; Rev. Daniel Curry, D.D.,
N.Y.; Rev. Edwin F. Hatfield, D.D., N.Y.; Rev. F.&nbsp;C. Ewer, D.D.,
N.Y.; Bishop Charles E. Cheney, Chicago, Ill., and others will
answer the above questions.</p>

<p class="center large">THE AMERICAN MISSIONARY.</p>

<hr class="tb" />


<p class="medium">No Christian family can afford to be without missionary
intelligence, and no missionary society can afford to be without
readers of its publications; it had better give them to the readers
without pay than to have no readers. Missionary zeal will die in
the churches without missionary intelligence.</p>

<p class="medium">But it would be far better for both the societies and the readers
if missionary news were paid for. This would give the magazine
attentive perusal and the society relief from the reproach of a
large expense for publication. Missionary publications should be
put on a <em>paying basis</em>. Aside from a free list to life members,
ministers, etc., the cost of publication should be made up by
paying subscribers and advertisements.</p>

<p class="medium">We are anxious to put the <span class="smcap">American Missionary</span> on this
basis. We intend to make it worth its price, and we ask our patrons
to aid us:</p>

<p class="medium">1. More of our readers can take pains to send us either the
moderate subscription price (50 cents), or $1.00, naming a friend
to whom we may send a second copy.</p>

<p class="medium">2. A special friend in each church can secure subscribers at
club-rates (12 copies for $5 or 25 copies for $10).</p>

<p class="medium">3. Business men can benefit themselves by advertising in a
periodical that has a circulation of over 20,000 copies monthly and
that goes to many of the best men and families in the land. Will
not our friends aid us to make this plan a success?</p>

<p class="medium">Subscriptions should be sent to <span class="smcap">H.&nbsp;W. Hubbard</span>, Treasurer,
56 Reade st., New York, N.Y.</p>

<hr class="tb" />


<p class="center">AIM AND WORK.</p>

<p class="medium">To preach the Gospel to the poor. It originated in a sympathy with
the almost friendless slaves. Since Emancipation it has devoted
its main efforts to preparing the <span class="smcap">Freedmen</span> for their
duties as citizens and Christians in America, and as missionaries
in Africa. As closely related to this, it seeks to benefit the
caste-persecuted <span class="smcap">Chinese</span> in America, and to co-operate
with the Government in its <a name="Err_2" id="Err_2"></a>humane and Christian policy toward the
<span class="smcap">Indians</span>.</p>

<p class="center">WANTS.</p>

<p class="medium">1. A steady <span class="smcap lowercase">INCREASE</span> of regular income to keep pace with
the growing work. This increase can only be reached by <em>regular</em>
and <em>larger</em> contributions from the churches, the feeble as well as
the strong.</p>

<p class="medium">2. <span class="smcap">Additional buildings</span> for our higher educational
institutions, to accommodate the increasing number of students;
<span class="smcap">Meeting Houses</span> for the new churches we are organizing;
<span class="smcap">more Ministers</span>, cultured and pious, for these churches.</p>

<p class="medium">3. <span class="smcap">Help for Young Men</span>, to be educated as ministers here
and missionaries to Africa&mdash;a pressing want.</p>
